		<p>I love my <a href="http://sidebar.io" target="_blank">Sidebar.io</a> daily email. It has great content that I care about (and deem useful.) It's well-designed. It's easy to use (sent straight to my inbox.) Yet it still finds its way to my archive without being read.</p>

		<p>Why does this happen? Because the tactics we use to encourage specific behaviors have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns" target="_blank">diminishing returns</a>.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Notifications? Get ignored over time.</li>
			<li>Email digest? Fade to your archived or trash.  </li>
			<li>Spiffy animations? Become normal, unnoticeable.</li>
			<li>Great content? Overloads, you start to skim or pass over.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Successful behavior requires balance. By keeping your product simple + focused, it's easier to determine the effects of each behavior change tactic (aka "a feature.")</p>

		<h3>Variability slows decay + increases productivity</h3>
		<p>Supplying rewards on a variable ratio (aka. "optimized" randomness) is a good way to stave off motivation fatigue.</p>

		<p>Let's look at Facebook notifications. They hook lots of people. Why? They are incredibly varied. You never know when you'll get one, and probably have no idea what it's for. It could be someone liking, inviting you, commenting, sharing, tagging, photobombing, etc.</p>

		<p>But get too many Facebook notifications and you'll start ignoring them. You feel pulled-in, wasted, and tired.</p>

		<p>Think of your inbox.</p>

		<p>If you keep reacting to emails all day, you become stressed. If you batch them out and dedicate small windows of your day to focus on email, you'll notice a huge jump in productivity - not just in taking care of email, but also in other aspects of your day.</p>

		<p>Back to Facebook. What if we applied a variable ratio schedule to notification <i>delivery</i>. Above a certain point, notifications could be batched and sent at later (carefully calculated) times. This could alleviate notification fatigue + increase engagement.</p>

		<p>Keep diminishing returns in mind during your next design session. Think of balance. Think of how you can take advantage of interval variability to not only increase engagement, but help your user spend their time more wisely throughout their day.</p>

		<p>A word of caution on optimizing your product for addication: each feature (read: extra cognitive load) drains bits of motivation, sapping away at blood sugar, and <a href="http://www.blog.theteamw.com/2009/11/07/100-things-you-should-know-about-people-8-dopamine-makes-us-addicted-to-seeking-information/" target="_blank">shorting out their dopamine loop</a>. I highly recommend reading Kathy Sierra's post <a href="http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/7/24/your-app-makes-me-fat" target="_blank">"Your App Makes Me Fat"</a> to recognize potential damage you may be causing.</p>
